Choose a DOS GL driver (gl.dxe) from one of the directories listed below
and put it in the same place as glh2dos.exe:

* fxmesa : This is based on the old Mesa version 3.4.2. Doesn't support
           new features of latest Voodoo4/5 series cards; but for me it
           was the only version that run smoothly with my Voodoo5 5500.

* mesa   : This is based on the well-known Mesa library, version 6.0.2.

* sage   : This is based on the SAGE library of Daniel Borca.

Also do remember to pick the correct glide driver (glide3x.dxe) for your
3dfx card from the voodoo directory.
