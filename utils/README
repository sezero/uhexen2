This package is put together essentially by merging two files
released by Raven, namely H2_UTILS.EXE (for original Hexen II)
and h2mputil.zip (for the mission pack), with addition of a few
other tools written by the community.

The tools, as they were released, lacked proper documentation.
I extracted most of the information below from quake utilities
packages.

hcc	: HCode (HexenC) compiler. From Raven's h2mputil package.
	  Reads "progs.src", then compiles all of the files listed
	  there.  Generates progs.dat for use by hexen2 at runtime,
	  progdefs.h for use in engine compilation, and files.dat
	  to be used as input for qfiles.

hcc_old	: Same as above, but the old version used for original
	  Hexen II. From Raven's h2_utils package. It doesn't work
	  for newer projects like the mission pack or hexenworld.
	  It is included here for compatibility with old stuff.

maputils: Map compiling tools (qbsp, light, vis). From Raven's
	  h2mputil package. Also includes bspinfo, which dumps
	  the count and size statistics on a .bsp file.

texutils: bsp2wal: extracts all textures from a bsp file. WAL
	  format is documented in the hwal.h header.
	  lmp2pcx: converts hexen2 texture data into pcx and tga.

genmodel: The 3-D model grabber. From Raven's h2mputil package.
	  Combines skin graphics with 3d frames to produce a .mdl
	  file. The commands are parsed out of .hc files.

qfiles	: From Raven's h2mputil package. Builds pak files based
	  on the contents of "files.dat" writen out by hcc. It
	  can also regenerate all of the .bsp models used in a
	  project, which is required if any changes to the file
	  format have been made.

jsh2color: A light colouring utility that generates .LIT files.
	  Taken from the old jshexen2 sources.

dcc	: An old progs.dat decompiler (and compiler) for Hexen2 by
	  Eric Hobbs. It may be of interest due to its decompiler
	  facilities.
