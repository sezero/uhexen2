Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Instructions for Compiling:
---------------------------

To compile the your own binaries, you need a unix build environment. The
makefiles also present several build options, please read them. Makefiles
rely on some scripts residing in the scripts directory. You may be able
to modify them to meet your needs, if necessary, but the defaults should
work just fine.

By editing the makefiles, you can change some compile time options. Other
than the makefiles, we have gathered most, if not all, of our compile time
options in the header file named "h2option.h".  You can edit it, as well,
but be careful.

Here is the recommended software for building:


Tools needed:

Make	:	The GNU make utility.
		Minimum version required is 3.78.  Versions 3.79.1 and
		newer are recommended.

binutils:	A GNU collection of binary utilities.
		Minimum version required is 2.9.5. Tested with versions
		2.11.9x and newer. Recent versions are recommended.

NASM	:	Netwide Assembler. An x86 assembler.
		Minimum version required is 0.98.  Versions 0.98.38 and
		0.98.39 recommended.
		YASM, a re-write of NASM, is also supported: Versions
		0.5.0rc2 and 0.5.0 are tested.
		Nasm is required for compiling hexen2 and hexenworld on
		ia32 machines. The makefile presents an option to not use
		x86 assembly even on ia32 machines, but this only works
		for the opengl renderer for now. 

GCC	:	GNU C Compiler. No other compilers (such as LCC, MS VC,
		etc) are tested.

		Minimum version required is GCC 2.95.  GCC versions in
		the 2.95/2.96 and 3.x series work fine.  Gcc 3.2.2 and
		newer recommended.

		Gcc-2.91.66 (aka. egcs-1.1.2) still seems to work, but
		the resulting binaries are not tested much. Even 2.7.2
		is reported to compile fine (it doesn't like the -march
		option, though.)

		Gcc-4.0 quirks:
		Gcc 4.0.x series has a problem when unit-at-a-time mode
		is active, such as with optimizations -O2 and -O3, with
		the resulting hexen2 binary segfaulting when a crusader
		class player uses his tome'd ice mace.
		When the build system detects gcc-4.0.x series compilers,
		it automatically disables unit-at-a-time, therefore there
		will be no problems with the default build options.
		With GCC 4.1.0, this problem doesn't exist.
		The blocking against unit-at-a-time mode can be forcefully
		enabled/disabled by adding a DISABLE_UNIT_AT_A_TIME=yes
		(or no) statement on the make commandline or by exporting
		it as an environment variable.
		This problem showed up after the cmd layer synchronization
		between hexen2 and hexenworld trees (october 2005).

Libraries needed:

GLIBC	:	Linux C libraries.
		Any glibc >= 2.1 should be fine. Not tested with anything
		older. As for FreeBSD, only version >= 5.3 is tested.

SDL	:	Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries.
		Minimum version required is 1.2.4.
		Required for compiling hexen2 and hexenworld client on
		unix systems.

SDL_mixer:	SDL mixer library.
		Minimum version required is 1.2.4. 1.2.5 and newer highly
		recommended at runtime.
		Required for midi playback support on unix. Should be
		compiled with timidity+ support. The makefiles present
		an option for disabling midi support, in that case this
		library will not be necessary.

ALSA	:	Advanced Linux Sound Architecture libraries.
		Minimum version required is 1.0.1. Version 0.9.8 should
		theoretically work, but not tested. 1.0.7 or newer are
		recommended at runtime.
		Necessary, if you want to support ALSA sound on Linux.
		The makefiles present an option for disabling ALSA sound
		support, in that case this library will not be necessary.

Compiling for Windows:

a. On Linux, using MinGW cross compiler:
----------------------------------------
See the MinGW FAQ on the MinGW homepage, and read the icculus.org cross
compiling tips (link down below). The icculus.org page gives prebuilt
cross compiler tools. Download and install them, or prepare your own cross
compiler. You can then run the "build_cross_win32.sh" scripts residing in
all directories. Read the scripts and edit them as necessary.
I compiled all of the Hammer of Thyrion 1.4.1 windows binaries on linux
using a snapshot of MinGW from Sep. 03, 2006. Both glibc-2.3 binaries and
the sources for this snapshot can be found on our downloads page under
the support files section.

b. On Windows, using win32-native MinGW compiler:
-------------------------------------------------
Download a prebuilt MinGW installer and install it to C:\MinGW .  Then
download MSys (as of this writing, latest is 1.0.11-2004.04.30), and
install to c:\msys . For assembly, download nasm (0.98.39 is latest)
and put the nasmw.exe into the C:\MinGW\bin directory. Adding the mingw
directory to your PATH may be a good idea, too. MinGW-3.1.0 comes with
gcc-3.2.3.  MinGW 4.1.1 or 5.0, on the other hand, come with gcc-3.4.x.
I currently use MinGW-5.0.3 when I compile on Windows.
Open a console window, cd into \msys and type "msys sh.exe". You'll be
in a unixish sh environment. The rest is just like doing things in linux:
cd into your fake "home directory", extract the HoT tarball, then change
into into each subdirectory you want to build and normally use the make
commands to compile.
Note that "make" may be named "mingw32-make". In that case, you may want
to try "mingw32-make" if "make" command itself fails to run. Remember to
do a make clean between each different build.


Compiling the software renderer for non-x86:
--------------------------------------------
As of version 1.4.2-rc2, the software renderer clients can be compiled
for non-x86 cpus: not as perfect as the intel code, yet, but it works in
general. On the other hand, it is still possible to compile them as 32
bit binaries for intel compatible cpus, such as amd64: for that you must
add -m32 to the cpu and linker flags and link against 32 bit versions
of any necessary libraries.
