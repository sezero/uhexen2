Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

Known Bugs
---------------------------

- Linux (Unix): Midi music doesn't work in combination with SDL sound
  driver due to conflicting SDL and SDL_mixer calls. To be looked into.

- Linux (Unix): OSS sound code does not work for a few people, either
  partially or completely. If you suffer from that problem, use Alsa
  or SDL sound.

- OpenGL Client: The so-called fix we adopted during 1.2.2 development
  for the extra lines drawn in rendering fires of Demoness and Praevus
  is actually an incomplete workaround (and is adding extra mess). The
  unwanted extra lines still appear but only for the first time.  This
  should be fixed in a better way (R_DrawSpriteModel, probably?).  See
  the workaround in gl_vidnt.c, gl_vidsdl.c, gl_rmain.c.

- Hexen II dedicated server: The decorative swords in the village1 and
  demo2 levels are located out of place. To be looked into.

- Hexen II dedicated server: Some teleportation sounds get lost by being
  marked as 'not audible at all' in S_StartSound(). To be looked into.

- HexenWorld: Coop mode is broken. Known problem since Raven's latest
  beta versions.

- 3dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2:  Palettized textures are broken with
  the old Mesa 3.x drivers. The new Mesa-6.x drivers work fine. Windows
  people should use the latest "MesaFX" driver.

- 3dfx Voodoo: May not work correctly with multitexturing when running
  with gl_luminance lightmaps. This is a 3dfx problem. For best results,
  use Mesa-6.2 on Linux and the latest "MesaFX" driver on Windows.

- Matrox G200: GL games may not display menus correctly (Matrox bug?)
