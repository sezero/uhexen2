Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion

TODO:
---------------------------

- Add joystick support through sdl
- Add pthread support to the utilities
- Do a clean-up of the opengl system
- Add sequencer support for midi
- Make the software renderer "intel-free" someday
- Re-write midi code for wildmidi and /or remove the SDL_mixer
  dependancy: I don't like opening the sound device twice.
- Add multisampling support to win32
- More unification of hexen2 and hexenworld trees
- Reduce the number of lines in BUGS ;)
- Re-visit the extra patches, fix and merge (e.g.: fog, etc.)
