Breakable window or wall

You can manually control the heirarchy of breaking by targeting all the brushes you want this brush to break.
If you target a light with this object and turn on the "breaklight" spawnflag, it will turn off that light when it's broken.  The light will default to 300 if no lightvalue1 is given.

AUTOMATIC LINKING OPTIONS:
killall - when killed, the brush will kill all connected brushes
hierarch - link all brushes in a hierarchy.  The hierarchy priority is set in the 
			  frags field of each brush.  Lower numbers will kill higher numbers.  If
			  brushes share the same priority, they will die at the same time.
nolink - don't automatically link this brush with other brushes (use only manual targeting to link)
checkname - link brushes, but also check the name you place in the netname field.
				Brushes must then not only touch, but also have the same netname to link
ordered - like hierarch, except that no matter which brush you kill, the brushes 
			 will always break in a certain order.  The order is set in the frags field.
			 The brush with a frags set to 1 will break first, brush with frags set to
			 2 will break second, etc.

OTHER FIELDS:
translucent - you can see through it
invincible - can't be shot and broken, but will break by linking

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity.  The

It will rotate around the Z axis by default.  You can
check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.
BREAK makes the brush breakable
REVERSE will cause the it to rotate in the opposite direction.
GRADUAL will make it slowly speed up and slow down.
TOGGLE_REVERSE will make it go in the other direction next time it's triggered
KEEP_START means it will return to it's starting position when turned off

"speed" determines how fast it moves; default value is 100.
"dmg"	damage to inflict when blocked (2 default)
"lifetime" this will make it stop after a while, then start up again after "wait".  Default is staying on.
"wait" if it has a lifetime, this is how long it will wait to start up again.  default is 3 seconds.
"thingtype" type of brush (if breakable - default is wood)
"health" (if breakable - default is 25)
"abslight" - to set the absolute light level
"anglespeed" - If using GRADUAL, this will determine how fast the speed up and down will occur.  1 will be very slow, 100 will be instant.  (Default is 10)

thingtype - type of chunks and sprites it will generate

"speed" - how fast the train should move to this path corner.  This will change the train's default speed to whatever you specify.  Nice for trains that should speed up and slow down.  No speed will let the train move at whatever speed it was last set to.
"angles" - how much to modify the train's angles by.  So if you set it at '0 90 0', and the train was at an angle of '30 60 90', the train would rotate unitl it's angles equalled '30 150 90'
"anglespeed" - how fast the train should rotate to the new angle.  Again, this will change the train's default anglespeed.
The defaults of all of these are 0.

The train spawns at the first target it is pointing at.
If the train is the target of a button or trigger, it will not begin moving until activated.

"distance" - in pixels, how far to move
"speed" - how fast it moves between spots (default=100)
"anglespeed" - how fast it rotates to a new angle (default = 100)
"wait" - -1 will make it stop forever, -2 will make it blow up (you can put the waits on the pathcorners and it will take the wait from there.
NOTE: If you give it a wait of -2, be sure to set the thingtype.

"pausetime" - How long to wait after getting to the end of it's path before blowing up, default is 0

"weaponmodel" - A model file to use instead of train visuals, but will have the blocking shape of the train you make
NOTE:  You should use a origin brush in the train and make sure you know where the origin of the model you're using is at.

The train will modify it's angles by whatever angles it's next path point has, so if it heads towards a path corner with an angle of '0 90 0', the train will rotate '0 90 0' on it's way to the pathpoint.  If you make the anglespeed the same as the angle, the turn should finish right as the train gets to the new spot.

NOTE: A path_corner using spawnflag "SYNCH" will make the train automatically calculate a new anglespeed based on the distance it's going and will finish the turn at the same time the move is done.

As usual, any rotating brush needs an origin brush.

"abslight" - to set the absolute light level
"angles" - only used for models attached to trains.

if TRAIN_GLOW is checked, changes to a light globe sprite and lights up an area
SLOPE - Train will automatically find the pitch and yaw it needs to get from path_corner to path_corner
ANGLEMATCH - If it has an attached model, that model's angles will change with the train's
USE_ORIGIN - Use an origin brush as origin for moving along path, not south-west-bottom corner.
ANGLE_WAIT - Train will not change angles until it reached path_corner, and will not move again until that angle movement is done

If you give it a targetname, it will wait to be activated, this can be seperate from the object it's attached to.

If something is blocking the spawnspot, this will telefrag it as long as it's not a living entity (flags2&FL_ALIVE)

You can set up as many spots as you want for it to spawn at and it will cycle
between these.  Make them classname func_monsterspawn_spot and
their spawnername has to match this entity's spawnername.
You can control the order in which they are used by setting thier
aflag (1, 2, 3, etc- there is NO ZERO, that's for you designers!)
You should give the spawner an aflag too if you want it's origin
included in the cycle of spawning, but if there are no spawn spots (just a spawner), no aflag is needed anywhere.

WARNING!!!  If you forget to put spawnspots and you give the spawner a spawnername, it will go into an infinite loop and the Universe will cease to exist!

If you only want monsters to spawn at the monster spawner origin, then don't worry about aflags or the spawnername, it will know... It's that cool.

The Monsters will be spawned at the origin of the spawner (and/or spawnspots), so if you want them not to stick in the ground, put this above the ground some- maybe 24?  Make sure there's enough room around it for the monsters.

ONDEATH = only spawn the new monster after the last has died, defaults to FALSE (doesn't wait)
TRIGGERONLY = Will only spawn a monster when it's been used by a trigger.  The default is continous spawning.
wait = time to wait after spawning a monster until the next monster is spawned, defaults to 0.5 seconds. If there are multiple spawn spots, this will be the time between cycles (default 0.5)
cnt = number of monsters, max to spawn, defaults to 17 (no reason, just like that number!)	If there are multiple spots, this should be the total off ALL the spots, including the spawner itself.
aflag = order in the spawning cycle
spawnername = spawnspots to look for- be sure to make spawnspots!
targetname = not needed unless you plan to activate this with a trigger

There will be a test on this on Thursday.  Interns are NOT exempt.

/*QUAKED trigger_counter (.5 .5 .5) ? nomessage ordered always_return deactivated
Acts as an intermediary for an action that takes multiple inputs.

nomessage = it will print "1 more.. " etc when triggered and "sequence complete" when finished.
ordered = things must be triggered in order to make the counter go off
always_return = Buttons will pop back to ready position even if successful (default is that they stay down once correct combination is found)

 - The triggers that trigger the counter need to be ordered using the "aflag" field
 - The first trigger is 1, second is 2, etc.
 - If a trigger is hit out of order, the counter resets
 - Triggers need a name in their netname function, the same name must be in the counter triggers netname fields (the target of the counter should NOT have a netname field, only the things triggering the counter)
 - Count must still be the number of triggers until the counter fires, minus 1 (don't ask why)

"wait" = how long to wait after successful before giving it another try.  Default is -1, meaning it works once and shut off.  If you specify a wait time, the trigger will become a multiple trigger.
"mangle" = This entity has the ability to have a non-sequential sequence of numbers as a combination using mangle.
The format is like a vector, for example, if you want the counter (ordered) to work only if the cnt order of 3, 5, 7 is used, enter the value "3 5 7" (no quotes).
A trigger_combination_assign trigger can pass it's "mangle" value to trigger_counter when it uses it.
This way you can have a number of different possible combinations that could be used and only one wouldbe right (depending, say, on which path the player took).
The values can be as high as you like (okay, from 1 to 65336), so you can have any number of buttons in this puzzle.

After the counter has been triggered "count" times (default 2), it will fire all of it's targets and shut off, unless you specify a wait time.

delay1 - delay10: "-1" = stop forever, 0 = wait for next trigger, >0 = wait this long before next sound
loop = number of times to loop
NOTE: no next voice (0) and no next delay (0) will make it wait for a trigger event and start all over again from the beginning of the list

EXAMPLE:
voice1 = 1	//play sound 1
delay1 = 1	//wait 1 second
voice2 = 10	//play sound 10
delay2 = 3	//wait 1 second
voice3 = 17	//play sound 17
//!! NOTE: no value (0) for delay3 means to wait until it's triggered again to continue.  If there WERE no .voice[4] value(0), it would just start back at the beginning on the next triggering.
//a -1 value in a delay will make it not be triggerable again after this point

//Next triggering: 
voice4 = 22	//play sound 22
delay4 = 2	//wait 2 seconds
voice5 = 13	//play sound 13
delay5 = 2	//wait 2 seconds
voice6 = -2	//Tells it to go back to voice2
loop = 3		//repeat loop 3 times before moving on
delay6 = 1	//after last loop finished, wait 1 second and continue. A zero value here would make it wait for the next triggering to continue

voice7 = 4	//play sound 4
delay7 = -1	//Stop here and never trigger again

resultant sound sequence:
1
10
17
wait for trigger
22
13
10 (start first loop)
17
wait for trigger

fluffy - All largish flakes
mixed - Mixed flakes
half_bright - All flakes start at most half bright (darker snow)
