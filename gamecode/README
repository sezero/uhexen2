Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (uHexen2) - GAMECODE
------------------------------------------------

Changes
-------

2013-08-02 (1.29):
===================
- portals/damage.hc (T_Damage): make sure target is a player (FL_CLIENT)
  before checking its camera_time and return: spider.spiderActiveCount
  and player.camera_time overlap in entity union and can make spiders
  invincible, otherwise. issue has been there since Raven's v1.12.
- siege/client.hc: in Climb(), changed a bitwise and to logical and to
  better match the code to v0.15 (was a typo from KS's changes.)  in
  PlayerPostThink(), fixed a misplaced else case for the landing sound
  code to better match the code to v0.15 (was a typo from KS's changes.)
  in ClientObituary(), changed targ.deathtype check from falling to fall
  to match the v0.15.x code elsewhere in client.hc.
- siege: removed again raven, snake, spider, scorpion, skullwiz, medusa,
  archer, hydra, faspell, fablade and fangel hc files from build. they
  were added to build along with KS's siege changes back in 2005, but
  they aren't really used, and they weren't in siege-v0.15 either...
- combat.hc (FireMelee): broke the long if condition for the assassin's
  backstab into smaller 3 nested ifs ordered in the likelihood of truth.
  in siege version, changed some of the if conditions into else if (the
  player class checks.)
- ravenstf.hc (create_raven_shot2, hw and siege versions): removed the
  DAMAGE_YES assignment to missile.solid, just like we did for the h2
  and portals versions years ago. (must have been there by mistake as
  noticed by Pa3PyX; used to cause missiles to be of SOLID_TRIGGER type
  and collide with each other.)
- ravenstf.hc (missle_straight, hw and siege versions): removed useless
  return statement from the end of the function.

2013-03-08 (1.28):
===================
- Map cycling: abandoned the old community-invented (Kor Skarn) method
  of abusing strings.txt: it was intrusive and unsafe and ugly. The hw
  and siege hcode now use the standart quakeworld method of localinfo
  variables: see client.hc:NextLevel() for details. docs/README.hwsv is
  updated for brief user instructions on setting up a map cycling.

2012-10-01 (1.27):
===================
- client.hc, invntory.hc: artifact_active/artifact_low setting/clearing
  of ART_TOMEOFPOWER, ART_INVINCIBILITY, ART_INVISIBILITY and ART_HASTE
  are now done simply by using BITSET and BITCLR ops.
- h2/cube.hc (cube_find_target): fixed parens in the if construct. don't
  choose a monster whose controller is the same as the cube's controller
  i.e. the player's summoned imp. assign self as the cube's controller
  in UseCubeOfForce(). fixes backported from the mission pack version.
- breakabl.hc,client.hc,doors.hc,subs.hc,weapons.hc,world.hc: replaced
  several while(1){} and do{}while(1) loops by loop{} which is shorter.
- weapons.hc (CycleWeaponCommand, CycleWeaponReverseCommand): removed an
  unnecessary local variable and changed the loop into a while(1) loop
  and simplified a bit. made them to return in in an impossible case of
  weapon not being one of IT_WEAPON1..4. changed the portals version to
  use switch statements.
- h2/items.hc, portals/items.hc (weapon_touch): IT_WEAPON4 must be OR'ed
  to new items, not added to. fix copied over from hexenworld version.
- h2/items.hc (weapon_touch) : commented out other.oldweapon assignment
  to other.weapon. was causing weapon switching to get stuck if several
  weapons were picked up too fast. see:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/uhexen2/forums/forum/425206/topic/5635367
- h2/weapons.hc (W_DeselectWeapon): added else cases for the necromancer
  for self.oldweapon == IT_WEAPON2 && self.oldweapon != IT_WEAPON3, and
  for self.oldweapon == IT_WEAPON3 && self.oldweapon != IT_WEAPON2,
  simply calling W_SetCurrentAmmo() same as the portals and hw versions
  do.
- setstaff.hc (scarab_die): fixed a typo in chain removal code. the bug
  was at least as old as v0.42 of hexen2. noticed the fix in hexenworld.
- commented out several dprints, several whitespace adjustments.
- Bumped version number to 1.27.

2012-05-22 (1.26):
===================
- fish.hc (fish_follow):  Proceed only if the goalentity is a valid one.
  Also made it to return if the function puts the fish into bored state.
- Bumped version number to 1.26.

2012-01-15 (1.25):
===================
- h2/axe.hc (axetail_run): if no owner, remove self and return (just
  in case. merged from the mission pack.)
- h2/weapons.hc: Fixed occasional crashes with Paladin's axe (H2MP 1.12a
  patch to the rescue...)
- some minor clean up
- Bumped version number to 1.25.

2011-07-03 (1.20):
===================
- Bumped version number to 1.20.
- Commented out unreferenced create_swarm() from h2 version of pstboar.hc
  (already disabled or removed in all other versions.)
- Reset skull wizard's .enemy and .goalentity fields to world. Fixes bug
  #3314808 where, if there were a summoned imp around, a blinked away
  wizard wouldn't reappear even after imp went away. From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed bug where the summoned imp didn't pick the Egypt snake boss as an
  enemy. (Set the snake's ALIVE flag. From Thomas Freundt.)
- Soul spheres: Made the soul sphere in sync with the skull or the cross.
  Changed the model lighting style to fullbright so now the skull and the
  cross are well discernible in dark places. The soul sphere can now gain
  momentum during spawning and fly around instead of hovering over the
  dead body and sometimes got stuck. Scaled down the soul at the end of
  its lifetime. Added the demoness among the list of bad people in the
  portals version in parallel to the hw version. Corrected minor errors
  and some inconsistencies.  From Thomas Freundt.  Also, in case of rider
  bosses, don't spawn a soul sphere because it won't be accessible anyway
  and may confuse the player.
- Now that we added a modified ent file for the Cathedral level, removed
  the ugly hack of reducing the teleport push speed to 225 for this level
  from triggers.hc::teleport_touch.
- Made sure that gaze attack sound doesn't persist when medusa is dead.
- When an imp lord dies, clear the ALIVE flag before removing, otherwise
  eidolon might get confused and rendered idle. From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed mezzoman.hc bug which would prevent yakman from appearing during
  the 'Trial of Strength' in the Temple of Phurbu (tibet7) level of the
  mission pack, rendering the level not completable (bug #1112533). From
  Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed a mission pack T_Damage() bug where a pentacle monster in tibet1
  became invulnerable when it got crushed by a door. The design flaw in
  the union in entity.hc is documented.
- Fixed a bug where werepanthers became "undead" when an assassin killed
  them by her bombs. From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed a bug which might prevent Eidolon to land. From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed Eidolon bugs which might prevent the finale screen to trigger.
  From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed a bug which used to prevent the finale screen to trigger if
  Praevus were killed too quickly in buddha_die() and buddha_run().
  From Thomas Freundt.
- Fixed trigger_crosslevel() with spawnflag 8, i.e. the clash with
  SPAWNFLAG_ACTIVATED, which used to prevent one of the prizes in Temple
  of Mars to appear. We now just set inactive property back to FALSE
  after calling InitTrigger(). From Keith Rozett.
- Added a "mapfixes" section. Added entity fixes for cath, demo2, egypt4,
  egypt5, romeric5 and tower maps of the original game and tibet2 and
  tibet9 maps of the expansion pack among the mapfixes.
- strings.txt: Fixed egypt2 wheel of ages message to report 360 degrees
  instead of 30 when it "points to a jackal". From Sander van Dijk.

2008-01-01 (1.19a):
===================
- Updated the patch shell scripts for much better compatibility with BSD
  and other systems. No other source code or binary data change.
2006-03-18 (1.19):
===================
- Origin fixes for tomed fires of vorpal sword and purifier: paladin used
  to fire them always from the non-crouched eye position, and it was even
  the worst when he was looking up (and down). You won't be shooting your
  back when standing just in front of a wall and fire your tomed purifier
  to the sky, from now on ;)

2006-12-01 (1.16a):
===================
- Fixed an obscure bug where the assasin with her 4th weapon uses the tome
  of power and can't fire it. The bug was reported by Mathias Schlueter to
  Jacques 'Korax' Krige who forwarded the report to us.  (The bug seems to
  have been introduced in gamecode-1.12g when a patch from Pa3PyX's sources
  was merged. Pa3PyX's own progs as part of his 1.15 package also has the
  same bug.)

2006-10-30 (1.16) :
===================
- Fixed the dreaded mezzoman bug causing the following error:
	SV_StartSound: fangel/deflect.wav not precached
	ADDRESS -14227(?) 537(last_attack).last_attack -14226(?)
	mezzoman.hc : mezzo_reflect_trig_touch
	<NO FUNCTION>
	assignment to world entity
	Host_Error: Program error
- Merged a probably better fix for the above bug. (from Steven).
- Disabled impulse 11 (ServerflagsCommand): it is a dev command, can
  be issued from any client and may screw up the server pretty bad..
- Made the hexen2 progs to work with demo version 1.11: the original
  demo version excluded the necromancer and crusader classes, but the
  later one didn't care and included them. changing some precache_model3
  and precache_sound3 to precache_model and precache_sound solves it.
  the pak file of 1.11 demo version already contains the necessary stuff.
- Made the hexenworld progs to work with demo version 1.11: Raven
  actually did all of the changes, but they seem to have missed
  changing the precache_model2 calls to precache_model in wp_art.hc
  which prevented crusader and necromancer classes to be played with.
- Ported the demo-1.11 precache compatibility changes from hexen2 to
  the mission pack. the mission pack actually has nothing to do with
  the demo version, but this is for the sake of the two trees being
  in sync as much as possible.
- Ported the demo-1.11 precache compatibility changes from hexenworld to
  siege. siege actually doesn't have much to do with the demo, but this
  is for the sake of the two trees being in sync as much as possible.
- Cleaned up and tweaked hexenworld and siege map cycling.
- Fixed hexen2 and hexenworld server crashes upon deathmatch level change
  in cases of a custom map being run and there is no map cycling. mission
  pack actually didn't used to crash but it always failed changing into
  a new level. it is now fixed, as well.
- Since version 1.11 of hexen2 demo already contains the demo3 level and
  it also has necessary stuff for running the hexenworld dm maps, added
  demo3 and the hw dm maps to FindDMLevel(). Similarly changed the hexen2
  and the mission pack versions.

2006-03-20 (1.15) :
===================
- hw: fixed the server crash when the server is spawned with dmmode 1.
  solution found in the ghost mod.
- hw: properly notify users when dmmode is changed. also remove the
  brightfield from the icon holder when dmmode 1 is abandoned. code
  found in the the ghost mode.
- hw / siege: broadcast the names of the current map and the
  next map in cycle to all clients
- noexit is supposed to matter only for deathmatch, not for coop
  and singleplayer
- CheckRules (timelimit and fraglimit) is supposed to matter only
  for deathmatch, not for coop and singleplayer
- fixed those double semicolons.
- hw: killed the irritating Poisong_die dprint
- fixed those famous spelling errors.

2005-08-09 (1.14) :
===================
- Disallowed cycling to a weapon without proper mana (S.A)
- Enabled impulse 34, (puzzle piece inventory list)  (S.A)
- Map cycling: minor cleanups
- Bumped the teleport-push speed to a highest safe value of 225
  (250 is still safe, but just in case)  and restricted that to
  the Cathedral map when not in deathmatch.  Otherwise, Raven's
  original value (300) is used.
- added Pa3PyX' fire delay bits for paladin's staff

2005-03-17 (1.12h):
===================
Merged the actual H2MP 1.12-1.12a patch and it has been missing
here in the CVS for ages. That no one told me about it is a bit
embarassing....

2005-02-23 (1.12g):
===================
Merged a bunch of fixes/adjustments from Pa3PyX' sources:
- fixed ravenstaff bug where splitting missiles would collide
  with each other
- setstaff tomed and untomed fire rates now fps independent
- crossbow fire rate fps now independent (also makes fire rate
  slightly faster, but I liked it ;)
- no more 20 tornadoes per second from meteor staff at 200 fps
- framerate independent Flame Orb fire procedure
- fix demoness abilities according to the manual
- assasin backstab starts at level 6
- crusader holy strength starts at level 6
- necromancer sickle steal adjustments to make it really useful
- assasin cloak ability re-write
- start crusader full-mana ability at level3

2005-02-15 (1.12f):
===================
- added an optional patch file which allows compiling boss maps into
  hwprogs.dat. this is not of much use, because coop seems broken..
- updated the hexenworld boss files according to H2MP. although coop
  is broken as of now, maybe someone messes with these one day...
- added stubs for the hexenworld missing boss-map functions. hwsv no
  longer crashes on maps rider1a, rider2c, romeric6, meso9 and eidolon.
- Applied Kor Skarn's further changes to the Siege hcode: this is the
  code to the hwprogs.dat in "sgcycle.zip" (seems to be first intended
  for the Rival Kingdoms mod?)
- Applied map cycling patch for Siege (similar to the one below)
- Added the hcode for Siege.
- Applied map cycling for HexenWorld (by Kor Skarn).

	forward. Fixes the unreachable Cathedral balcony issue for
	me (for both Hexen2 and H2MP) (2005-01-06).

1.12c	fixed eidolon losing his hostility upon destruction of the orb.
	(2005-01-05, adaptation of eidolon.hc from H2MP)
1.12b	fixed eidolon not jumping off the ledge (hc/h2/triggers.hc)
	(2004-12-09)
